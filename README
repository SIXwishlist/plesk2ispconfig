NAME
        plesk2ispconfig - convert Plesk installations to ISPconfig


SYNOPSIS
        plesk2ispconfig [--config=file.yml]


DESCRIPTION

This script helps you migrate most of your Plesk installation to ISPconfig,
namely client accounts, mail addresses (mailboxes, aliases and forwards), web
sites and some databases. You configure it through a simple config file, mainly
for the credentials to access your installations and your server addresses, and
the rest should be fully automatic.

OPTIONS
    --config FILE
        A YAML config file, see below.
    --modules MODULE[,MODULE ...]
        Modules to run. Default is to run all available.
    --listmodules
        List available modules and exit.
    --domains DOMAIN[,DOMAIN ...]
        Process only these domains.
    --robust
        Print an error message and continue on database or SOAP communication
        errors instead of aborting.
    --debug
        Print fairly detailed information to help trace where things go wrong/


CONFIGURATION

Configuration is through a file written in YAML (http://yaml.org). The default
looks like this---just replace the values in there but don't change the format.
The script validates the contents though to make sure everything it needs is
there.

The "plesk" and "ispconfig" sections should be self-explanatory: they specify
how to access your respective installations. While ISPconfig has a reasonably
easy SOAP interface (in as far as that can be said about *any* SOAP interface),
Plesk's homegrown "XML RPC" is a complete train wreck so I speak SQL directly to
its database. This has only been tested with Plesk 9.5 though!

The "server" section simply specifies your ISPconfig server IPs. If you have
only one server for several functions (web/mail/db), just specify the same
address repeatedly.

The "defaults" contain settings that are found in ISPconfig but not directly
equivalent in Plesk. The following might need explanation:

ip_map: map old Plesk web server IPs to new ISPconfig ones. If you had several
        IPs and your sites distributed across them, this will recreate the
        same distribution in ISPconfig.
allow_override: Apache-style directive as you'd put into an .htaccess file for
        every site.
maildir: A printf-style string that has "%d" replaced by the mail domain and
        "%a" by the account name. Some people prefer the full mail address in
        the final part, like "/var/vmail/%d/%a@%d", or for very small sites
        "/var/vmail/%a@%d"
stats_type: The kind of webstats program the site wants. I have no idea whether
            anything besides "webalizer" really works.
postscript: The name of a script that plesk2ispconfig will write and that must
            be executed on the ISPconfig system later to complete the migration.
            As ISPconfig sensibly hands off more complicated actions such as
            website creation to a cron job, we can't assume all of that has been
            done when an API call returns so we have to defer rsyncing of
            websites and dumping/restoring of databases as well. After the
            script finishes, copy the file to the target server, wait ~10min and
            execute it. It uses the user, host and port entries under
            plesk->sync to log in to the Plesk system using SSH. Every step
            opens a new connection so you better set up public-key
            authentication to this account if you want to avoid typing the same
            password over and over again.
mailsync: plesk2ispconfig writes an offlineimaprc file named as specified under
          "writerc". Using this to run the "offlineimap" tool, you can
          synchronize IMAP accounts from source to target, even if they use
          different server software. "fromserver" is the server name to connect
          to, in case it's not the one Plesk runs on; this field can use the
          "%d" placeholder for the client account's domain name. The default
          would read IMAP data for user@example.com from mail.example.com.

BUGS AND LIMITATONS

Many. This should be considered alpha-quality software  as many things are not
quite finished or  even begun:
- The database format may have changed  in Plesk 10 and cause things to break.
  If you have a Plesk10 installation that you'd like to convert, send me a dump
  (edit out your passwords though, they are stored in clear text) and I'll have
  a look.
- Custom name servers are not supported yet, and client databases only if they
  are used for a web site; in particular only Drupal sites (sorry, most of our
  clients use that) are supported for automatic discovery of client credentials.
- Web stats should be preserved if using the same system (webalizer, awstats
  etc.) on both installations, but are not.
- Error handling is rather crude.
